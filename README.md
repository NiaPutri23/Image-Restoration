# **Image Restoration and Classification Project Using Filtering Techniques and Machine Learning**
This project aims to perform image restoration on images with added noise using several filtering techniques and classify images using machine learning techniques on noisy and restored images.

## Introduction to the project 
In this project, we will perform several tasks to process images, starting from adding noise, restoring images using various filtering techniques, to classifying images using machine learning. The tasks are as follows:
1. Adding several noise models to images.
2. Performing image restoration with various filtering techniques (spatial filtering, order statistic filtering, adaptive filtering).
3. Explaining the restoration methods and classification techniques.
4. Analyzing the results of image restoration using various filtering techniques.
5. Performing classification with machine learning techniques on noisy and restored images.
6. Analyzing the performance evaluation of classification models with degraded and restored image inputs (optional).

## Program Steps 
1. Adding Noise Models to Images using `Gaussian noise and Salt n Pepper noise`
2. Restoring Image using filtering techinques: Spatial filtering (Mean) and Order statistic filtering (Median)
3. Classificating image class using random forest algorithm
4. Classificating restored image class using random forest algorithm
5. Performance evaluation analysis using accuracy score, F1 score
6. Comparing the results of prediction model between original images and restored images
